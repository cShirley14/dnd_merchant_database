# DnD Merchant Database
* Objective:
  * A database that covers use cases for a comic book store.
  
* Designed a database using MySQL, modeling use cases for a Comic Store Merchant

* Developed an Entity-Relationship Diagram identifying primary and foreign keys, indices, table relationships, and columns along with data type values

* Developed MySQL script to build the database and query for information relevant to the operations of a Comic Book Store including:
  1) Three triggers (two updates, one delete) related to verifying invoice totals, sanitizing payment data, and auditing of deleted data
  2) Two views showing real-time outstanding and processing customer-payment data, and sales agents assigned to vendors
  3) Four stored procedures automating the process of populating invoice total data based on invoice line items, the process of populating invoice payment data, the updating of paid invoice statuses, and providing data on the number of sales the company made based on month and year inputs

* Outlined functional dependencies for the database

* Developed a Database Dictionary outlining the utility, data types, and purpose behind the database's structure
